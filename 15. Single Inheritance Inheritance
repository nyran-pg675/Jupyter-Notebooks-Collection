# Single Inheritance Inheritance is basically Python’s way of letting one
# class borrow or reuse stuff from another class. Think of it like a child
# inheriting traits from a parent — same vibe.

# Example:
# You create a Animal class with eat() and sleep()
# Then your Dog and Cat classes can just inherit that instead of writing it again.

# It helps you group related classes.
# Like:
# Vehicle → parent class
# Car, Bike, Bus → child classes

# Parent class
class pet_animal:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def behaviour(self):
    print(f"{self.name} like his owner very much and loves to cuddle!")

# child class
class dog(pet_animal):
  def bark(self):
    print(f"{self.name} barks to stranger!")

  def dog_behaviour(self):
    print(f"{self.name} like to play throw and fectch!")

dog1 = dog('Tommy')
dog1.bark()
dog1.behaviour()
dog1.dog_behaviour()


# Another child class
class cat(pet_animal):
  def meow(self):
    print(f"{self.name} meows to stranger!")
cat1 = cat("Blacky")
cat1.meow()
