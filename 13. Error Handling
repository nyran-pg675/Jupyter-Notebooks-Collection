Error handling is the process of writing code that can detect and respond to runtime errors (mistakes that happen while a program is running).
Python uses try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle these errors gracefully so your program doesn’t crash unexpectedly.

try:  # This block contains code that might cause an error / Python will try to run this code.
    a = 5
    b = 0
    print(a / b)
except: # If an error occurs inside the try block / Python will skip the rest of the try code and jump to except.
    print("Can't divide by zero")

output: Can't divide by zero

try:
    # risky code
except:
    # runs if there is an error
else:
    # runs if there is no error
finally:
    # runs no matter what happens

Explanation of Each Block:
try-Code that might raise an error.
except-Code that runs only if an error occurs.
else-Code that runs only if no error occurs.
finally-Code that always runs, whether there was an error or not (useful for cleanup tasks, like closing files or database connections).

Example function with try, except, and finally 
def divide(a, b):
  try:
      results = (a/b)
      print(results)
  except:
        print("Can't divide by zero")
  finally:
        print("This will always execute")

divide(5,0)
